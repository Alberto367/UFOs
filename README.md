# UFOs
## Overview 
In this project we created a webpage where users can visit search and filter our data of UFO sightings. Useres will be able to filter through five catagories: date, city, state, country, and shape. In addition to these filters our tabledata also provides information on duration and comments.
### Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to provide a clear and clean webpage that is easy to read. The webpage will also provide filters as a way to sort through the large amount of data collected and be available to anyone.

## Results 
### Single filter
This webpage will be useful for someone who already has knowladge of a specific UFO sighting and wished to know more about that sighting. The user can input what information they know into one of the provided filters and the datatable will provide all the information we have.

### Multiple filters 
The user will also be able to narrow their search by applying multiple filters. For instance if they know the sigthing occured in California and only want to see a particular kind of sighting such as those shaped like trianles they can add both filters.

## Summary
- One drawback of this design is that the data entered to filter the table is very specific, such as capitalization if the user were to input "Bonita" instead of "bonita" the table would not return any data.
- One recommendation would be to include code that automatically decapitalizes the input data so our function can find the information.
- Another recommendation would be to provide ranges or examples for the filters so if the user wants to explore more options they know whats available instead of having to guess, for example in our filter shapes they could search round and find nothing but if they search disk theres data. In addition both searches disk and circle provide data but its different data eventhough they could mean the same thing.
- A final recommendation would be more options for inputing date so useres can search for either a single day or an entire month or even year.
